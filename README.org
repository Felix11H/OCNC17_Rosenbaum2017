** About

** Requirements
To run the network simulation a Python 3 environment with Brian 2 is required. A recommended way of installing the dependencies is for example using virtualenv and pip:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
#!/bin/sh

virtualenv -p python3 /home/$USER/env/ocnc-net
source /home/$USER/env/ocnc-net/bin/activate

pip install brian2
pip install matplotlib
#+END_SRC


** Network models

*** Balanced network  
In ~blncd_net~ a balanced network driven by external Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noisy currents is simulated. 

Run 
: source run.sh
