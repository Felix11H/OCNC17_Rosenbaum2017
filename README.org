** About
Brian 2 neural network simulations written as an educational project during the [[https://groups.oist.jp/ocnc/oist-computational-neuroscience-course-ocnc2017][OIST Computational Neuroscience Course]] in Okinawa, Japan. The networks aim to reproduce and extend results from 
#+BEGIN_SRC 
Rosenbaum, Robert, et al. "The spatial structure of 
correlated neuronal variability." 
Nature neuroscience 20.1 (2017): 107.
#+END_SRC

** Requirements
To run the network simulation a Python 3 environment with Brian 2 is required. A recommended way of installing the dependencies is for example using virtualenv and pip:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
#!/bin/sh

virtualenv -p python3 /home/$USER/env/ocnc-net
source /home/$USER/env/ocnc-net/bin/activate

pip install brian2
pip install matplotlib
#+END_SRC


** Network models

*** Balanced network  
In ~blncd_net~ a balanced network driven by external Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noisy currents is simulated. This is an (incomplete) attempt to reproduce Figure 1 of Rosenbaum et al. (2017). 

Run the simulation via
: source run.sh

In ~blncd_net/img/~ the following output is expected

*** Feedforward-recurrent network
In ~ffwd_rec~ a recurrent network with neuron distributed on a grid are driven by spatially distributed feedforward input similar to Figure 2-4 in Rosenbaum et al. (2017).

Run the simulation via
: source run.sh

In ~ffwd_rec/img/~ the following output is expected
#+html: <p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/felix11h/ocnc17-rosenbaum2017/blob/master/ffwd_rec/img/collated_preview.png" /></p>


*** Plastic feedforward-recurrent network 
In ~plst_net~ the model of Rosenbaum et al. (2017) is extended to include spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) and homeostatic plasticity.

Run the simulation via
: source run.sh

In ~plst_net/img/~ the following output is expected
