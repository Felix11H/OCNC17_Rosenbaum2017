** About
Brian 2 neural network simulations written as an educational project during the [[https://groups.oist.jp/ocnc/oist-computational-neuroscience-course-ocnc2017][OIST Computational Neuroscience Course]] in Okinawa, Japan. The networks partially reproduce and extend results from 
#+BEGIN_SRC 
Rosenbaum, Robert, et al. "The spatial structure of 
correlated neuronal variability." 
Nature neuroscience 20.1 (2017): 107.
#+END_SRC

** Requirements
To run the network simulation a Python 3 environment with Brian 2 is required. A recommended way of installing the dependencies is for example using virtualenv and pip:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
#!/bin/sh

virtualenv -p python3 /home/$USER/env/ocnc-net
source /home/$USER/env/ocnc-net/bin/activate

pip install brian2
pip install matplotlib
#+END_SRC


** Network models

*** Balanced network  
In ~blncd_net~ a balanced network driven by external Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noisy currents is simulated. 

Run 
: source run.sh
